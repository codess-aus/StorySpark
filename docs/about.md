# About StorySpark

## Our Mission

StorySpark was created to help people preserve their life stories and memories in a meaningful way. We believe that everyone has stories worth telling, and that the simple act of writing them down can be transformative.

## The Vision

In our fast-paced world, precious memories and meaningful experiences can easily be forgotten. StorySpark provides:

- **Thoughtful prompts** to help you remember and reflect
- **A simple platform** to record your stories
- **A collection** that grows over time, creating a legacy

Whether you're writing for yourself, your family, or future generations, StorySpark is here to support your storytelling journey.

## The Technology

StorySpark is built with:

- **MkDocs**: A modern documentation platform
- **Material for MkDocs**: A responsive, accessible theme
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, reliable hosting
- **AI-Generated Prompts**: Thoughtful questions designed to spark meaningful memories
